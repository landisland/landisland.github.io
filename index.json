[{"content":"Why Cross-Validation is Important? We often randomly split the dataset into train data and test data to develop a machine learning model. The training data is used to train the ML model and the same model is tested on independent testing data to evaluate the performance of the model.\nWith the change in the random state of the split, the accuracy of the model also changes, so we are not able to achieve a fixed accuracy for the model. The testing data should be kept independent of the training data so that no data leakage occurs. During the development of an ML model using the training data, the model performance needs to be evaluated. Here\u0026rsquo;s the importance of cross-validation data comes into the picture.\nLeave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) It is a category of LpOCV with the case of p=1.\nFor a dataset having $n$ rows, 1 st row is selected for validation, and the rest (n-1) rows are used to train the model. For the next iteration, the 2 nd row is selected for validation and rest to train the model. Similarly, the process is repeated until $\\mathrm{n}$ steps or the desired number of operations.\nBoth the above two cross-validation techniques are the types of exhaustive cross-validation. Exhaustive crossvalidation methods are cross-validation methods that learn and test in all possible ways. They have the same pros and cons discussed below:\nPros:\n Simple, easy to understand, and implement.  Cons:\n The model may lead to a low bias. The computation time required is high.  Holdout cross-validation The holdout cross-validation randomly splits the dataset into train and test data depending on data analysis.\nIn the case of holdout cross-validation, the dataset is randomly split into training and validation data. Generally, the split of training data is more than test data. The training data is used to induce the model and validation data is evaluates the performance of the model. The more data is used to train the model, the better the model is. For the holdout cross-validation method, a good amount of data is isolated from training.\nPros:\n Same as previous.  Cons:\n Not suitable for an imbalanced dataset. A lot of data is isolated from training the model.  k-fold cross-validation In k-fold cross-validation, the original dataset is equally partitioned into $\\mathrm{k}$ subparts or folds. Out of the k-folds or groups, for each iteration, one group is selected as validation data, and the remaining $(\\mathrm{k}-1)$ groups are selected as training data.\nThe process is repeated for $\\mathrm{k}$ times until each group is treated as validation and remaining as training data.\nThe final accuracy of the model is computed by taking the mean accuracy of the k-models validation data. $$ \\mathbf{a c c}{\\mathrm{cv}}=\\sum{\\mathbf{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\frac{\\mathbf{a c c}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathbf{k}} $$ Pros:\n The model has low bias Low time complexity The entire dataset is utilized for both training and validation.  Cons:\n Not suitable for an imbalanced dataset.  Repeated random subsampling validation Repeated random subsampling validation also referred to as Monte Carlo crossvalidation splits the dataset randomly into training and validation. Unlikely k-fold cross-validation split of the dataset into not in groups or folds but splits in this case in random.\nThe number of iterations is not fixed and decided by analysis. The results are then averaged over the splits. $$ \\mathbf{a c c}{\\mathrm{cv}}=\\sum{\\mathbf{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\frac{\\mathbf{a c c}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathbf{k}} $$ Pros:\n The proportion of train and validation splits is not dependent on the number of iterations or partitions.  Cons:\n Some samples may not be selected for either training or validation. Not suitable for an imbalanced dataset.  Stratified k-fold cross-validation For all the cross-validation techniques discussed above, they may not work well with an imbalanced dataset. Stratified kfold cross-validation solved the problem of an imbalanced dataset.\nIn Stratified k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is partitioned into $\\mathrm{k}$ groups or folds such that the validation data has an equal number of instances of target class label. This ensures that one particular class is not over present in the validation or train data especially when the dataset is imbalanced.\nThe final score is computed by taking the mean of scores of each fold.\nPros:\n Works well for an imbalanced dataset.  Cons:\n Now suitable for time series dataset.  Time Series cross-validation The order of the data is very important for time-series related problem. For timerelated dataset random split or k-fold split of data into train and validation may not yield good results.\nFor the time-series dataset, the split of data into train and validation is according to the time also referred to as forward chaining method or rolling cross-validation. For a particular iteration, the next instance of train data can be treated as validation data.\nNested cross-validation In the case of k-fold and stratified k-fold cross-validation, we get a poor estimate of the error in training and test data.\nHyperparameter tuning is done separately in the earlier methods. When cross- validation is used simultaneously for tuning the hyperparameters and generalizing the error estimate, nested cross-validation is required.\nNested Cross Validation can be applicable in both $k$-fold and stratified $k$-fold variants.\nConclusion Cross-validation is used to compare and evaluate the performance of ML models. In this article, we have covered 8 crossvalidation techniques along with their pros and cons. k-fold and stratified k-fold crossvalidations are the most used techniques. Time series cross-validation works best with time series related problems.\nReference\n","permalink":"/post/2022-03-02some-cross-validation-methods/","summary":"Summary about some cross-validation methods and their pros and cons","title":"Some Cross-Validation Methods"},{"content":"Some take out:\n If $p \\ge n$, least square method may have high variance, hence we use shrinkage method which can reduce variance.  1. Problem with linear regression with least square (ls)  Prediction Accuracy: linear regression has low bias but suffer from high variance, especially when $n \\approx p$. It cannot handle $n\u0026lt;p$. Model Interpretability: It is often the case that some or many of the variables used in a multiple regression model are in fact not associated with the response. Including such irrelevant variables leads to unnecessary complexity in the resulting model.  2. Selected alternatives to LS  Subset Selection. This approach involves identifying a subset of the $p$ predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We then fit a model using least squares on the reduced set of variables. Shrinkage. This approach involves fitting a model involving all $p$ predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. This shrinkage (also known as regularization) has the effect of reducing variance. Depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be estimated to be exactly zero. Hence, shrinkage methods can also perform variable selection.  Ridge Regression (Norm 2) Lasso (Norm 1) can estimate coefficients to zero   Dimension Reduction. This approach involves projecting the $p$ predictors into a $M$-dimensional subspace, where $M\u0026lt;\\mathrm{p}$. This is achieved by computing $M$ different linear combinations, or projections, of the variables. Then these $M$ projections are used as predictors to fit a linear regression model by least squares  Best subset selection  Let $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ denote the null model, which contains no predictors. This model simply predicts the sample mean for each observation.  For $k=1,2, \\ldots p$ : (a) Fit all $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}p \\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ models that contain exactly $k$ predictors.

Shrinkage in details Ridge regression Ridge regression is very similar to least squares, except that the coefficients are estimated by minimizing a slightly different quantity. In particular, the ridge regression coefficient estimates $\\beta^{R}$ are the values that minimize $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2}+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^{2}=\\mathrm{RSS}+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^{2} $$ where $\\lambda \\geq 0$ is a tuning parameter, to be determined separately. The above equation trades off two different criteria. As with least squares, ridge regression seeks coefficient estimates that fit the data well, by making the $RSS$ small. However, the second term, $\\lambda \\sum_{j} \\beta_{j}^{2}$, called a shrinkage penalty, is small when $\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{p}$ are close to zero, and so it has the effect of shrinking penalty the estimates of $\\beta_{j}$ towards zero.\nUnlike least squares, which generates only one set of coefficient estimates, ridge regression will produce a different set of coefficient estimates, $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}^{R}$, for each value of $\\lambda$. Selecting a good value for $\\lambda$ is critical.\nWe want to shrink the estimated association of each variable with the response; however, we do not want to shrink the intercept, which is simply a measure of the mean value of the response when $x_{i 1}=x_{i 2}=\\ldots=x_{i p}=0$. If we assume that the variables-that is, the columns of the data matrix $X$-have been centered to have mean zero before ridge regression is performed, then the estimated intercept will take the form $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}=\\bar{y}$. The shrinkage penalty is not scale invariant. Therefore, it is best to apply ridge regression after standardizing the predictors.\n$\\lambda$ Increases will lead to decrease of flexibility hence lower variance and higher bias.\nIn general, in situations where the relationship between the response and the predictors is close to linear, the least squares estimates will have low bias but may have high variance. This means that a small change in the training data can cause a large change in the least squares coefficient estimates. In particular, when the number of variables $p$ is almost as large as the number of observations $n$, the least squares estimates will be extremely variable. And if $p\u0026gt;n$, then the least squares estimates do not even have a unique solution, whereas ridge regression can still perform well by trading off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. Hence, ridge regression works best in situations where the least squares estimates have high variance.\nRidge regression compared to subset selection Ridge regression also has substantial computational advantages over best subset selection, which requires searching through $2^{p}$ models. As we discussed previously, even for moderate values of $p$, such a search can be computationally infeasible. In contrast, for any fixed value of $\\lambda$, ridge regression only fits a single model, and the model-fitting procedure can be performed quite quickly. In fact, one can show that the computations required to solve the penalized least square, simultaneously for all values of $\\lambda$, are almost identical to those for fitting a model using least squares.\n","permalink":"/post/2022-02-27linear-model-selection-and-regularization/","summary":"Summary about comparison between least square method and shrinkage method.","title":"Linear model selection and regularization"},{"content":"Bayes rule: type of a generative classifier (Bayes Classifier) We use Bayes rule as the basis for designing algorithms, as follows:\nGiven that we wish to learn some target function $f: X \\rightarrow Y$, or equivalently, $P(Y \\mid X)$, we use the training data to learn estimates of $P(X \\mid Y)$ and $P(Y)$. New $X$ examples can then be classified using these estimated probability distributions, plus Bayes rule. This type of classifier is called a generative classifier, because we can view the distribution $P(X \\mid Y)$ as describing how to generate random instances $X$ conditioned on the target attribute $Y$.\nBayes classifier is unrealistic, and then we have Naive Bayes classifier Learning Bayes classifiers typically requires an unrealistic number of training examples (i.e., more than $|X|$ training examples where $X$ is the instance space) unless some form of prior assumption is made about the form of $P(X \\mid Y)$. The Naive Bayes classifier assumes all attributes describing $X$ are conditionally independent given $Y$. This assumption dramatically reduces the number of parameters that must be estimated to learn the classifier. Naive Bayes is a widely used learning algorithm, for both discrete and continuous $X$.\nWhen $X$ is a vector of discrete-valued attributes, Naive Bayes learning algorithms can be viewed as linear classifiers; that is, every such Naive Bayes classifier corresponds to a hyperplane decision surface in $X$. The same statement holds for Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers if the variance of each feature $i$ is assumed to be independent of the class $k$ (i.e., if $\\sigma_{i k}=\\sigma_{i}$ ).\nLogistic regression: type of a discriminative classifier Logistic Regression is a function approximation algorithm that uses training data to directly estimate $P(Y \\mid X)$, in contrast to Naive Bayes. In this sense, Logistic Regression is often referred to as a discriminative classifier because we can view the distribution $P(Y \\mid X)$ as directly discriminating the value of the target value $Y$ for any given instance $X$.\nLogistic regression and Gaussian naive bayes Logistic Regression is a linear classifier over $X .$ The linear classifiers produced by Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes are identical in the limit as the number of training examples approaches infinity, provided the Naive Bayes assumptions hold. However, if these assumptions do not hold, the Naive Bayes bias will cause it to perform less accurately than Logistic Regression, in the limit. Put another way, Naive Bayes is a learning algorithm with greater bias, but lower variance, than Logistic Regression. If this bias is appropriate given the actual data, Naive Bayes will be preferred. Otherwise, Logistic Regression will be preferred.\nSummary We can view function approximation learning algorithms as statistical estimators of functions, or of conditional distributions $P(Y \\mid X)$. They estimate $P(Y \\mid X)$ from a sample of training data. As with other statistical estimators, it can be useful to characterize learning algorithms by their bias and expected variance, taken over different samples of training data.\nReference\n","permalink":"/post/2022-02-22what-you-should-know-about-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes/","summary":"Some take outs from machine learning","title":"What You Should Know About Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes"},{"content":"Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing Let\u0026rsquo;s see an example of a person is on trial for a criminal offense and the judge needs to provide a verdict on his case. Now, there are four possible combinations in such a case:\n First Case: The person is innocent and the judge identifies the person as innocent Second Case: The person is innocent and the judge identifies the person as guilty Third Case: The person is guilty and the judge identifies the person as innocent Fourth Case: The person is guilty and the judge identifies the person as guilty  Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis We consider the Null Hypothesis to be true until we find strong evidence against it. Then. we accept the Alternate Hypothesis. We also determine the Significance Level (⍺) which can be understood as the Probability of (Judge Decided Guilty | Person is Innocent) in the previous example. Thus, if ⍺ is smaller, it will require more evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. Don’t worry, we’ll cover all of this using a case study later.\nSteps to Perform Hypothesis Testing There are four steps to perform Hypothesis Testing:\n Set the Hypothesis Set the Significance Level, Criteria for a decision Compute the test statistics Make a decision  Steps 1 to 3 are quite self-explanatory but on what basis can we make a decision in step 4? What does thisp-value indicate?\nWe can understand this p-value as the measurement of the Defense Attorney’s argument. If the p-value is less than ⍺ , we reject the Null Hypothesis or if the p-value is greater than ⍺, we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.\nP-value is a numerical value between 0 and 1, the more it closes to 1, the more the predicted model is similar to the null hypothesis.\nCritical Value and P-value Typically, we set the Significance level at 10%, 5%, or 1%. If our test score lies in the Acceptance Zone we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis. If our test score lies in the critical zone, we reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the Alternate Hypothesis.\n Critical Value is the cut off value between Acceptance Zone and Rejection Zone. We compare our test score to the critical value and if the test score is greater than the critical value, that means our test score lies in the Rejection Zone and we reject the Null Hypothesis. On the opposite side, if the test score is less than the Critical Value, that means the test score lies in the Acceptance Zone and we fail to reject the null Hypothesis.\n But why do we need p-value when we can reject/accept hypotheses based on test scores and critical value?\np-value has the benefit that we only need one value to make a decision about the hypothesis. We don’t need to compute two different values like critical value and test scores. Another benefit of using p-value is that we can test at any desired level of significance by comparing this directly with the significance level.\nDirectional Hypothesis In the Directional Hypothesis, the null hypothesis is rejected if the test score is too large (for right-tailed and too small for left tailed). Thus, the rejection region for such a test consists of one part, which is right from the center.\nNon-Directional Hypothesis In a Non-Directional Hypothesis test, the Null Hypothesis is rejected if the test score is either too small or too large. Thus, the rejection region for such a test consists of two parts: one on the left and one on the right.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the z-Test? Z-tests are a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when either:\n We know the population variance, or We do not know the population variance but our sample size is large n ≥ 30  If we have a sample size of less than 30 and do not know the population variance, then we must use a t-test.\nOne-Sample z-Test We perform the One-Sample Z test when we want to compare a sample mean with the population mean.\nTwo-Sample Z Test We perform a Two Sample Z test when we want to compare the mean of two samples.\nWhat is the t-Test? t-Tests are a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when:\n We do not know the population variance Our sample size is small, n \u0026lt; 30  One-Sample t-Test We perform a One-Sample t-test when we want to compare a sample mean with the population mean. The difference from the Z Test is that we do not have the information on Population Variance here. We use the sample standard deviation instead of population standard deviation in this case.\nTwo-Sample t-Test We perform a Two-Sample t-test when we want to compare the mean of two samples.\nDeciding between z-Test and t-Test So when we should perform the Z test and when we should perform t-Test? It’s a key question we need to answer if we want to master statistics.\nIf the sample size is large enough, then the Z test and t-Test will conclude with the same results. For a large sample size, Sample Variance will be a better estimate of Population variance so even if population variance is unknown, we can use the Z test using sample variance.\nSimilarly, for a Large Sample, we have a high degree of freedom. And since t**-distribution approaches the normal distribution**, the difference between the z score and t score is negligible.\nReference\n","permalink":"/post/2022-02-21hypothesis-testing-and-difference-between-z-test-and-t-test/","summary":"Basic concepts of statistics","title":"Hypothesis testing and difference between z-Test and t-Test"},{"content":"What is Data Visualization?

Difference between homoscedastic and heteroscedastic Q-Q Plot and P-P plot We see that approximately 68% of the y-axis (region between red lines) corresponds to 1/3 of the x-axis (region between blue lines). That means that when we use the proportion of the distribution we have passed through to evaluate the match between two distributions (i.e., we use a pp-plot), we will get a lot of resolution in the center of the distributions, but less at the tails. On the other hand, when we use the quantiles to evaluate the match between two distributions (i.e., we use a qq-plot), we will get very good resolution at the tails, but less in the center. (Because data analysts are typically more concerned about the tails of a distribution, which will have more effect on inference for example, qq-plots are much more common than pp-plots.)\nHence, in statistics analysis, we use Q-Q plot more often because we want to focus on the tails of a distribution.\nHow to read Q-Q plot  Here\u0026rsquo;s what QQ-plots look like (for particular choices of distribution) on average:  But randomness tends to obscure things, especially with small samples:  Scale-Location Plot When looking at this plot, we check for two things:\n1.

That is, the spread of the residuals is roughly equal at all fitted values.\n2. Verify that there is no clear pattern among the residuals. In other words, the residuals should be randomly scattered around the red line with roughly equal variability at all fitted values.\nHere is an example to test your model\u0026rsquo;s homoscedasticity.\nResiduals vs. Leverage Plot Leverage refers to the extent to which the coefficients in the regression model would change if a particular observation was removed from the dataset.\nObservations with high leverage have a strong influence on the coefficients in the regression model.

Design Linked List\nDescription Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.\nImplement the MyLinkedList class:\n MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object. int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list. void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list.

This filed has two broad categories.\n Web development  Frondend Backend    Frontend Web Development A front end (client-side) is a website that a user can see and interact with. It can be also called a client-side because it is the part that the user(client) can see and interact with. Therefore, anything we see on any website when we surf on the internet is part of the front end and it includes the colors, fonts, buttons, images, videos, audios and any other content on the website.The technologies that uses to build front end parts of a website are called front end technologies. The core technologies to build a front end are:\n HTML CSS JavaScript  There are hundreds of JavaScript that allows building a dynamic web applications. Currently, the three most popular JavaScript libraries are:\n React Vue Angular  Backend Web Development Backed(Server-side) development refers to the activities that happens behind the scene. Backend development consists of backend a programming language and a database. The backend interacts with frontend and the database using a backend programming language that could be (Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc). Look at the following figure to understand the interaction between client. A client send a HTTP request to the backend and the backend return a HTTP response to the client computer(The response could be an HTML page, txt, image, or any other form of data). HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that allow transmitting data between a client and a sever. It is designed for communication between web browsers(client) and web servers.\nCredit to Asabeneh\nDay 02 What is HTML? HTML is an acronym, that it stands for Hypertext Markup Language .\nHTML Element HTML elements consists of an open tag \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, attribute(s), content and closing tag \u0026lt;\u0026gt;. Below is a demo.\n\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;Content\u0026lt;/tag\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome to 30 Days of HTML\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; The tag name is h1 and the content is 30 Days of HTML. The h1 will tell the browser to make the text a big font size, that\u0026rsquo;s why we call HTML a markup language.\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; HTML elements are the blocking of a website. There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build a website. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; The p tag marks the text to be paragraph.\nAttribute HTML attributes provide additional information about the element. An attribute can added only in the opening tag. It will be difficult to list down all HTML attributes but we can list down the most common ones.\n alt - to add information about added image, use with img element. autocompelete - to enable auto complete feature of a form, use with form and input. autofocus - enable auto focus of input fields autoplay - allows playing an audio/video on the page loads charset - enable character encoding of meta tag checked - to make a checkbox checked of an input element class - to give a common identifier for HTML elements cols - to determine the width of a textarea element contenteditable - make any element editable download - allows a link to download a resource(image, pdf, PPT, etc) draggable - to make an element draggable, apply to all elements for - to connect/bound a label element with a specific input field, use with a label tag href - to specify a URL or a path of a resource, use with a link tag id - a unique id for an HTML element, apply to all elements lang - specifies the language of the page type - specifies the type of the element and it uses with only a certain elements src - to specify URL of a media file(img, audio, video, source, embed, script) style - to add an inline CSS style to an element  There are also event listener attribute that listen mouse or keyboard. For instance, onclick, onsubmit, onkeydown, onkeyup, onscroll, etc. Remember, do not try to remember by hard. For detail information about, HTML attributes you may check this link.\n\u0026lt;p style=\u0026#34;color:gray;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; HTML elements are the blocking of a website. There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build a website. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; The above p tag has a style attribute. The style attribute has a color property and a value gray. The style changes the text color to gray. You can try it by adding other property and value in the style. Each value has to be separated by a semicolon.\nSome HTML elements do not have closing tag, instead they have self-closing tag.\nAn example of self closing tags:\n\u0026lt;area /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;col /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;embed /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hr /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;para /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;track /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;wbr /\u0026gt; The slash is optional but I strongly recommend to use the slash with self-closing tags. For instance, React.js does not allow you to use without the slash.\nHTML Comment Comment in any programming language help a code to be more readable. Therefore, it is common to leave some text on a code to make it more readable and maintainable. Let us the syntax of an HTML comment, it has opening ()\n\u0026lt;!-- The is an HTML comment and it makes the code more readable --\u0026gt; Day02 Exercise  What is the acronym HTML stands for?  Hypertext Markup Language   What is an HTML element?  Element consists of a \u0026lt;\u0026gt; attribute(s) content  \u0026lt;/\u0026gt;   What is an attribute  Attribute can provide additional information about the element   Write at least five HTML attributes  style alt src type class   Where do you write an attribute to HTML element?

An IDE, a code editor   What is the purpose of the browser?  Browser render your HTML code to a human read website   Does every element need to have attributes?  Not necessarily    Day 03 DOM DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is structure like a tree. It starts with an html root element followed by head and body. The head and the body are the immediate children of the root element, html. Before the root element, there is a declaration.\nDeclaration Before the root element, there is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML. Therefore, the browser render it to the way an HTML suppose to be rendered.\nThis is the code to declare an HTML. The declaration is not part of the DOM tree.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; Root Element The html element is the root of the DOM tree and is the parent of head and body.\nThe DOM tree has to be wrapped by the html tag.\nThe html tag with two children, head and body.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; content goes here \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; his a simplistic DOM structure that contains html, head, title, body, h1 elements.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The DOM tree of the above HTML looks like the following diagram.\nHeading Elements HTML is a markup language. We mark a content using an HTML tag and the browser render it to a clean web page. The h1 tag means making a text to be a large font size text, by default it creates 32px size text. We have h1 to h6 different tags to write different font size title. Pixel(px) is a unit to measure size which is as small as a dot.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;First level heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Second level heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Third level heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Fourth level heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Fifth level heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;Sixth level heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The size of the h1 to h6 tags:\n h1 is 32px (2em) h2 is 24px (1.5em) h3 is 20.8px (1.3em) h4 is 16px (1em) h5 is 12.8px (0.8em) h6 is 11.2px (0.7em)  Paragraph Element Now, let\u0026rsquo;s add paragraph to our web page using the p tag.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build websites and web applications \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now, there are six elements in the above HTML code. An HTML element may have a parent, a child, sibling(s). The html element is the root or the parent of the head and body. The head and body are children of the htmltag.The head and body are siblings. The title is the child of the head. The body has two children, the h1 and p.\nSection Element If we went to create section for our page, we can use div or section element. Section element has semantic meaning. Let\u0026rsquo;s add div in the previous page.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML.

Instead of div, a section can be also used\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML.

Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict.

The sign of $w^Tx=0$ tells us which side of the plane $w^Tx=0$, the point x lies on. Thus by taking threshold as 0, perceptron classifies data based on which side of the plane the new point lies on.\nThe task during training is to arrive at the plane (defined by w) that accurately classifies the training data. If the data is linearly separable, perceptron training always converges\nLogistic Regression In Logistic regression, we take weighted linear combination of input features and pass it through a sigmoid function which outputs a number between 1 and 0. Unlike perceptron, which just tells us which side of the plane the point lies on, logistic regression gives a probability of a point lying on a particular side of the plane. The probability of classification will be very close to 1 or 0 as the point goes far away from the plane. The probability of classification of points very close to the plane is close to 0.5.\nSVM There can be multiple hyperplanes that separate linearly separable data. SVM calculates the optimal separating hyperplane using concepts of geometry.\nPerceptron Model Definition of Perceptron Model A perceptron model, in Machine Learning, is a supervised learning algorithm of binary classifiers. A single neuron, the perceptron model detects whether any function is an input or not and classifies them in either of the classes.\n Representing a biological neuron in the human brain, the perceptron model or simply a perceptron acts as an artificial neuron that performs human-like brain functions. A linear ML algorithm, the perceptron conducts binary classification or two-class categorization and enables neurons to learn and register information procured from the inputs.\n There are 4 constituents of a perceptron model. They are as follows-\n Input values Weights and bias Net sum Activation function  The perceptron model enables machines to automatically learn coefficients of weight which helps in classifying the inputs. Also recognized as the Linear Binary Classifier, the perceptron model is extremely efficient and helpful in arranging the input data and classifying the same in different classes.\nHow perceptron model operates  Enter bits of information that are supposed to serve as inputs in the first layer (Input Value). All weights (pre-learned coefficients) and input values will be multiplied. The multiplied values of all input values will be added. The bias value will shift to the final stage (activation function/output result). The weighted input will proceed to the stage of the activation function. The bias value will be now added. The value procured will be the output value that will determine if the output will be released or not.

Being a lazy classifier, it is difficult to use this for prediction in real time. The decision boundaries you achieve with K-NN are much more complex than any decision trees, thus obtaining a nice classification. When you are solving a problem which directly focusses on finding similarity between observations. K-NN does better because of its inherent nature to optimize locally. This is also a flipside because, outliers can significantly kill the performance. Additionally, K-NN is most likely to overfit, and hence adjusting k to maximize test set performance is the way to go. As the complexity of the space grows, the accuracy of K-NN comes down and you would need more data, but the order of this classifier is $n^2$ and it becomes too slow. So, a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA, SVD etc are typically applied and subsequently this classifier is used.\nNaive Bayes is an eager learning classifier and it is much faster than K-NN. Thus, it could be used for prediction in real time. Typically, email spam filtering uses Naive Bayes classifier. It takes a probabilistic estimation route and generates probabilities for each class. It assumes conditional dependence between the features and uses a maximum likelihood hypothesis. The best part with this classifier is that, it learns over time. In a spam filtering task, the type of spam words in email evolves over time. In the same way, the classifier also calculates probability estimates for the newly occurring spam words in a\u0026quot;bag of words\u0026quot;model and makes sure it performs well. This feature of the classifier is due to the inherent nature of the algorithm being generative and not discriminative.\nWhy Naive Bayes is Naive?

Compute the distance between currently classifier sample and training points, remember the index of the element with the smallest distance (ignore previously selected points) 2. Add the class at found index to the counter Return the class with the most votes as a prediction This is a nested loop structure, where the outer loop takes k steps and the inner loop takes n steps. 3rd point is $O(1$) and 4th is $O(\\text{number of classes})$, so they are smaller. Additionally, we have to take into consideration the numer of dimensions d, more directions mean longer vectors to compute distances. Therefore, we have $O(n * k * d)$ time complexity.\nAs for space complexity, we need a small vector to count the votes for each class. It’s almost always very small and is fixed, so we can treat it as a O(1) space complexity.\nBall tree method Training time complexity: $O(d * n * log(n))$\nTraining space complexity: $O(d * n)$\nPrediction time complexity: $O(k * log(n))$\nPrediction space complexity: $O(1)$\nBall tree algorithm takes another approach to dividing space where training points lie. In contrast to k-d trees, which divides space with median value “cuts”, ball tree groups points into “balls” organized into a tree structure. They go from the largest (root, with all points) to the smallest (leaves, with only a few or even 1 point). It allows fast nearest neighbor lookup because nearby neighbors are in the same or at least close “balls”.\nDuring the training phase, we only need to construct the ball tree. There are a few algorithms for constructing the ball tree, but the one most similar to k-d tree (called “k-d construction algorithm” for that reason) is $O(d * n * log(n))$, the same as k-d tree.\nBecause of the tree building similarity, the complexities of the prediction phase are also the same as for k-d tree.\nk-d tree method Check a demonstration video here.\nTraining time complexity: $O(d * n * log(n))$\nTraining space complexity: $O(d * n)$\nPrediction time complexity: $O(k * log(n))$\nPrediction space complexity: $O(1)$\nDuring the training phase, we have to construct the k-d tree. This data structure splits the k-dimensional space (here k means k dimensions of space, don’t confuse this with k as a number of nearest neighbors!) and allows faster search for nearest points, since we “know where to look” in that space. You may think of it like a generalization of BST for many dimensions. It “cuts” space with axis-aligned cuts, dividing points into groups in children nodes.\nConstructing the k-d tree is not a machine learning task itself, since it stems from computational geometry domain, so we won’t cover this in detail, only on conceptual level. The time complexity is usually $O(d * n * log(n))$, because insertion is $O(log(n))$ (similar to regular BST) and we have n points from the training dataset, each with d dimensions. I assume the efficient implementation of the data structure, i. e. it finds the optimal split point (median in the dimension) in O(n), which is possible with the median of medians algorithm. Space complexity is $O(d * n)$ — note that it depends on dimensionality d, which makes sense, since more dimensions correspond to more space divisions and larger trees (in addition to larger time complexity for the same reason).\nAs for the prediction phase, the k-d tree structure naturally supports “k nearest point neighbors query” operation, which is exactly what we need for kNN. The simple approach is to just query k times, removing the point found each time — since query takes $O(log(n))$, it is $O(k * log(n))$ in total. But since the k-d tree already cuts space during construction, after a single query we approximately know where to look — we can just search the “surroundings” around that point. Therefore, practical implementations of k-d tree support querying for whole k neighbors at one time and with complexity $O(sqrt(n) + k)$, which is much better for larger dimensionalities, which are very common in machine learning.\nThe above complexities are the average ones, assuming the balanced k-d tree. The O(log(n)) times assumed above may degrade up to $O(n)$ for unbalanced trees, but if the median is used during the tree construction, we should always get a tree with approximately $O(log(n))$ insertion/deletion/search complexity.\nChoosing the method in practice To summarize the complexities: brute force is the slowest in the big O notation, while both k-d tree and ball tree have the same lower complexity. How do we know which one to use then?\nTo get the answer, we have to look at both training and prediction times, that’s why I have provided both. The brute force algorithm has only one complexity, for prediction, $O(k * n)$. Other algorithms need to create the data structure first, so for training and prediction they get $O(d * n * log(n) + k * log(n))$, not taking into account the space complexity, which may also be important. Therefore, where the construction of the trees is frequent, the training phase may outweigh their advantage of faster nearest neighbor lookup.\nShould we use k-d tree or ball tree? It depends on the data structure — relatively uniform or “well behaved” data will make better use of k-d tree, since the cuts of space will work well (near points will be close in the leaves after all cuts). For more clustered data the “balls” from the ball tree will reflect the structure better and therefore allow for faster nearest neighbor search. Fortunately, Scikit-learn supports “auto” option, which will automatically infer the best data structure from the data.\nLet’s see this in practice on two case studies, which I’ve encountered in practice during my studies and job.\nCase study 1: classification The more “traditional” application of the kNN is the classification of data. It often has quite a lot of points, e. g. MNIST has 60k training images and 10k test images. Classification is done offline, which means we first do the train ing phase, then just use the results during prediction. Therefore, if we want to construct the data structure, we only need to do so once. For 10k test images, let’s compare the brute force (which calculates all distances every time) and k-d tree for 3 neighbors:\nBrute force $(O(k * n))$: 3 * 10,000 = 30,000\nk-d tree $ (O(k * log(n)))$: 3 * log(10,000) ~ 3 * 13 = 39\nComparison: 39 / 30,000 = 0.0013\nAs you can see, the performance gain is huge! The data structure method uses only a tiny fraction of the brute force time. For most datasets this method is a clear winner.\nCase study 2: real-time smart monitoring Machine Learning is commonly used for image recognition, often using neural networks. It’s very useful for real-time applications, where it’s often integrated with cameras, alarms etc. The problem with neural networks is that they often detect the same object 2 or more times — even the best architectures like YOLO have this problem. We can actually solve it with nearest neighbor search with a simple approach:\n  Calculate the center of each bounding box (rectangle)\n  For each rectangle, search for its nearest neighbor (1NN)\n  If points are closer than the selected threshold, merge them (they detect the same object)\n  The crucial part is searching for the closest center of another bounding box (point 2). Which algorithm should be used here? Typically we have only a few moving objects on camera, maybe up to 30–40. For such a small number, speedup from using data structures for faster lookup is negligible. Each frame is a separate image, so if we wanted to construct a k-d tree for example, we would have to do so for every frame, which may mean 30 times per second — a huge cost overall. Therefore, for such situations a simple brute force method works fastest and also has the smallest space requirement (which, with heavy neural networks or for embedded CPUs in cameras, may be important).\nHow to choose a proper k?

Typically we have few if any data points with $X=4$ exactly, so we cannot compute $E(Y|X=x)$ !\nWhat we do is to relax the definition and let:\n$$ \\hat{f}(x)=\\operatorname{Ave}(Y \\mid X \\in \\mathcal{N}(x)) $$ where $\\mathcal{N}(x)$ is some neighborhood of $x$.\nBuild linear model $$ f_{L}(X)=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} X_{1}+\\beta_{2} X_{2}+\\cdots+\\beta_{p} X_{p} $$\n  A linear model is specified in terms of $p+1$ parameters $\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\u0026hellip;,\\beta_p$\n  We estimate the parameters by fitting the model to training data\n  Although it is almost never correct, a linear model often serves as a good and interpretable approximation to the unknown true function $f(X)$\n  Interpretability and Flexibility  Why under-fitting is bad?  If a model is under-fitting, it means the model even cannot fit the training data, let alone the testing data or use it in real-world cases   Why over-fitting is bad?  Although the model can fit training data well, but it\u0026rsquo;s too \u0026ldquo;well\u0026rdquo;, we cannot use it in other cases.   How do we know when the fit is just right? Parsimony v.s. black box  We often prefer a simpler model involving fewer variables over a black-box predictor involving them all.    Accessing Model Accuracy Suppose we fit a model $\\hat{f}(x)$ to some training data $\\operatorname{Tr}=\\left{x_{i}, y_{i}\\right}_{1}^{n}$, and we wish to see how it performs.\nWe could compute the average squared prediction error over $\\text{Tr}$: $$ M S E_{T r}=A v e_{i \\in \\operatorname{Tr}}\\left[y_{i}-\\hat{f}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2} $$ And then we compute it using fresh test data $\\operatorname{Te}=\\left{x_{i}, y_{i}\\right}{1}^{n}$ : $$ M S E{T e}=A v e_{i \\in \\operatorname{Te}}\\left[y_{i}-\\hat{f}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2} $$ Black curve is truth. Red curve on right is $M S E_{T e}$. Grey curve is $M S E_{T r}$.\nOrange, blue and green curves/squares correspond to fits of different flexibility.\nChoose the flexibility based on average test error amounts to a bias-variance trade-off.\nSupervised learning : classification problems Here the response variable $Y$ is qualitative , e.g. email is one of $\\C = \\text{(spam, ham)}$, ham is good email ; digit class is one of $\\C = {0, 1, \u0026hellip;,9}$.\nOur goals  Build a classifier $C(X)$ That assigns a class label from $\\C$ to a future unlabeled observation $X$ Access the uncertainty in each classification Understand the roles of the different predictors among $X=X_1, X_2,\u0026hellip;,X_p$  Bayes optimal classifier Suppose the $K$ elements in $\\C$ Are numbered $1,2,\u0026hellip;,K$, Let: $$ p_k(x)=\\text{Pr}(Y=K|X=x),k=1,2,\u0026hellip;K $$ These are the conditional/posterior class probabilities at x. Suppose those class probabilities are known, the Bayes optimal classifier at $x$ is: $$ C(x)=j \\text { if } p_{j}(x)=\\max \\left{p_{1}(x), p_{2}(x), \\ldots, p_{K}(x)\\right} $$\n","permalink":"/post/2022-01-21notedata-mining-analysis-intro/","summary":"Some basic Python summary","title":"Note|Data Mining \u0026 Analysis Intro Ep.0"},{"content":"Create table CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (\u0026#34;CustomerID\u0026#34; INT, \u0026#34;PartySize\u0026#34; INT) Insert data INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (ID, NUMBER) VALUES (123,81) INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (ID, NUMBER) VALUES ((SELECT ID FROM COLUMN_NAME WHERE Email=\u0026#34;1232@GMAIL.com\u0026#34;), 4) Look for similarity SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, Reservation.Date FROM Reservation JOIN Customer AS C ON C.ID = Reservation.ID WHERE C.LastName LIKE \u0026#34;Ste%\u0026#34; Check availablity SELECT COUNT(Books.Title) FROM Loans JOIN Books ON Loads.BookID = Books.BookID WHERE Books.Title = \u0026#34;Dracula\u0026#34; AND Loans.ReturnedDate IS NULL Filter _ underscore: a single character wildcard.\n% percent sign: a wildcard for one or more characters.\n* asterisk: represents zero or more characters\nSQL string funcitons SUBSTR( string, start, length ) LENGTH( string ) TRIM( string) #Trimming is case sensitive.

Unique Email Addresses From 929. Unique Email Addresses\n1.1 Problem Description Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@'sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+'.\n For example, in \u0026quot;alice@leetcode.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;alice\u0026quot; is the local name, and \u0026quot;leetcode.com\u0026quot; is the domain name.  If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.\n For example, \u0026quot;alice.z@leetcode.com\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;alicez@leetcode.com\u0026quot; forward to the same email address.  If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.\n For example, \u0026quot;m.y+name@email.com\u0026quot; will be forwarded to \u0026quot;my@email.com\u0026quot;.  It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.\nGiven an array of strings emails where we send one email to each emails[i], return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.\n1.2 Solution We can use split() and replace here:\n split() is to split email address using @ as identifier replace is to use \u0026quot;\u0026quot; to replace .  class Solution: def numUniqueEmails(self, emails: List[str]) -\u0026gt; int: actual = set() for email in emails: local, domain = email.split(\u0026#39;@\u0026#39;) local = local.split(\u0026#39;+\u0026#39;)[0].replace(\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) actual.add((local, domain)) return len(actual) 2.

Rotate String From 796. Rotate String\n3.1 Problem Description Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.\nA shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.\n For example, if s = \u0026quot;abcde\u0026quot;, then it will be \u0026quot;bcdea\u0026quot; after one shift.  Example 1:\nInput: s = \u0026#34;abcde\u0026#34;, goal = \u0026#34;cdeab\u0026#34; Output: true Example 2:\nInput: s = \u0026#34;abcde\u0026#34;, goal = \u0026#34;abced\u0026#34; Output: false 3.2 Solution One easy way to solve this problem is we can find out that string goal is also in s + s if goal is rotated from s.\nclass Solution: def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -\u0026gt; bool: return len(s) == len(goal) and goal in s + s 4. Most Common Word From 819. Most Common Word\n4.1 Problem Description Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.\nThe words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.\nExample 1:\nInput: paragraph = \u0026#34;Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.\u0026#34;, banned = [\u0026#34;hit\u0026#34;] Output: \u0026#34;ball\u0026#34; Explanation: \u0026#34;hit\u0026#34; occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word. \u0026#34;ball\u0026#34; occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as \u0026#34;ball,\u0026#34;), and that \u0026#34;hit\u0026#34; isn\u0026#39;t the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned. 4.2 Solution 4 steps:\n remove all punctuations change to lowercase words count for each word not in banned set return the most common word  class Solution: def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -\u0026gt; str: ban = set(banned) # \\w: Matches Unicode word characters, + means Repetition qualifiers words = re.findall(r\u0026#39;\\w+\u0026#39;, paragraph.lower()) print(words) # most_common(n most common elements) return collections.Counter(w for w in words if w not in ban).most_common(1)[0][0] ","permalink":"/post/2022-01-05leetcodepython-some-string-problems/","summary":"Leetcode problems about string","title":"Leetcode|Python Some String Problems"},{"content":"1.

Delete Node in a Linked List\n3.1 Problem Description Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.\nIt is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.\nExample\nInput: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5 Output: [4,1,9] Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -\u0026gt; 1 -\u0026gt; 9 after calling your function. 3.2 Solution Actually you can not really delete a node, you just skip this node and point to the next.\nclass Solution: def deleteNode(self, node): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; :type node: ListNode :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; node.val = node.next.val node.next = node.next.next 4.

Palindrome Linked List\n5.1 Problem Description Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.\nExample\nInput: head = [1,2,2,1] Output: true 5.2 Solution We can combine what we learned in 206. Reverse Linked List, first we try to get the reverse first half of linked list using slow and fast pointers, and then compare the value of the first half linked list with the second half of the linked list.\ndef isPalindrome(self, head): fast = slow = head # find the mid node, slow will point to the mid node while fast and fast.next: fast = fast.next.next slow = slow.next # reverse the second half node = None while slow: nxt = slow.next slow.next = node node = slow slow = nxt # compare the first and second half nodes while node: # while node and head: if node.val != head.val: return False node = node.next head = head.next return True 6. Linked List Cycle From 141. Linked List Cycle\n6.1 Problem Description Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\nThere is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail\u0026rsquo;s next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.\nReturn true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.\nExample\n6.2 Solution The idea is similar to 876.
