Design Linked List\nDescription Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.\nImplement the MyLinkedList class:\n MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object. int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list. void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

This filed has two broad categories.\n Web development  Frondend Backend    Frontend Web Development A front end (client-side) is a website that a user can see and interact with. It can be also called a client-side because it is the part that the user(client) can see and interact with. Therefore, anything we see on any website when we surf on the internet is part of the front end and it includes the colors, fonts, buttons, images, videos, audios and any other content on the website.The technologies that uses to build front end parts of a website are called front end technologies. The core technologies to build a front end are:\n HTML CSS JavaScript  There are hundreds of JavaScript that allows building a dynamic web applications. Currently, the three most popular JavaScript libraries are:\n React Vue Angular  Backend Web Development Backed(Server-side) development refers to the activities that happens behind the scene. Backend development consists of backend a programming language and a database. The backend interacts with frontend and the database using a backend programming language that could be (Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc). Look at the following figure to understand the interaction between client. A client send a HTTP request to the backend and the backend return a HTTP response to the client computer(The response could be an HTML page, txt, image, or any other form of data). HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that allow transmitting data between a client and a sever. It is designed for communication between web browsers(client) and web servers.\nCredit to Asabeneh\nDay 02 What is HTML? HTML is an acronym, that it stands for Hypertext Markup Language .\nHTML Element HTML elements consists of an open tag \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, attribute(s), content and closing tag \u0026lt;\u0026gt;. Below is a demo.\n\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;Content\u0026lt;/tag\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome to 30 Days of HTML\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; The tag name is h1 and the content is 30 Days of HTML. The h1 will tell the browser to make the text a big font size, that\u0026rsquo;s why we call HTML a markup language.\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; HTML elements are the blocking of a website. There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build a website. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; The p tag marks the text to be paragraph.\nAttribute HTML attributes provide additional information about the element. An attribute can added only in the opening tag. It will be difficult to list down all HTML attributes but we can list down the most common ones.\n alt - to add information about added image, use with img element. autocompelete - to enable auto complete feature of a form, use with form and input. autofocus - enable auto focus of input fields autoplay - allows playing an audio/video on the page loads charset - enable character encoding of meta tag checked - to make a checkbox checked of an input element class - to give a common identifier for HTML elements cols - to determine the width of a textarea element contenteditable - make any element editable download - allows a link to download a resource(image, pdf, PPT, etc) draggable - to make an element draggable, apply to all elements for - to connect/bound a label element with a specific input field, use with a label tag href - to specify a URL or a path of a resource, use with a link tag id - a unique id for an HTML element, apply to all elements lang - specifies the language of the page type - specifies the type of the element and it uses with only a certain elements src - to specify URL of a media file(img, audio, video, source, embed, script) style - to add an inline CSS style to an element  There are also event listener attribute that listen mouse or keyboard. For instance, onclick, onsubmit, onkeydown, onkeyup, onscroll, etc. Remember, do not try to remember by hard. For detail information about, HTML attributes you may check this link.\n\u0026lt;p style=\u0026#34;color:gray;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; HTML elements are the blocking of a website. There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build a website. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; The above p tag has a style attribute. The style attribute has a color property and a value gray. The style changes the text color to gray. You can try it by adding other property and value in the style. Each value has to be separated by a semicolon.\nSome HTML elements do not have closing tag, instead they have self-closing tag.\nAn example of self closing tags:\n\u0026lt;area /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;col /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;embed /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hr /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;para /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;track /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;wbr /\u0026gt; The slash is optional but I strongly recommend to use the slash with self-closing tags. For instance, React.js does not allow you to use without the slash.\nHTML Comment Comment in any programming language help a code to be more readable. Therefore, it is common to leave some text on a code to make it more readable and maintainable. Let us the syntax of an HTML comment, it has opening ()\n\u0026lt;!-- The is an HTML comment and it makes the code more readable --\u0026gt; Day02 Exercise  What is the acronym HTML stands for?

An IDE, a code editor   What is the purpose of the browser?  Browser render your HTML code to a human read website   Does every element need to have attributes?  Not necessarily    Day 03 DOM DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is structure like a tree. It starts with an html root element followed by head and body. The head and the body are the immediate children of the root element, html. Before the root element, there is a declaration.\nDeclaration Before the root element, there is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML. Therefore, the browser render it to the way an HTML suppose to be rendered.\nThis is the code to declare an HTML. The declaration is not part of the DOM tree.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; Root Element The html element is the root of the DOM tree and is the parent of head and body.\nThe DOM tree has to be wrapped by the html tag.\nThe html tag with two children, head and body.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; content goes here \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; his a simplistic DOM structure that contains html, head, title, body, h1 elements.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The DOM tree of the above HTML looks like the following diagram.\nHeading Elements HTML is a markup language. We mark a content using an HTML tag and the browser render it to a clean web page. The h1 tag means making a text to be a large font size text, by default it creates 32px size text. We have h1 to h6 different tags to write different font size title. Pixel(px) is a unit to measure size which is as small as a dot.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;First level heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Second level heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Third level heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Fourth level heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Fifth level heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;Sixth level heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The size of the h1 to h6 tags:\n h1 is 32px (2em) h2 is 24px (1.5em) h3 is 20.8px (1.3em) h4 is 16px (1em) h5 is 12.8px (0.8em) h6 is 11.2px (0.7em)  Paragraph Element Now, let\u0026rsquo;s add paragraph to our web page using the p tag.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML. Learn HTML and build websites and web applications \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now, there are six elements in the above HTML code. An HTML element may have a parent, a child, sibling(s). The html element is the root or the parent of the head and body. The head and body are children of the htmltag.The head and body are siblings. The title is the child of the head. The body has two children, the h1 and p.\nSection Element If we went to create section for our page, we can use div or section element. Section element has semantic meaning. Let\u0026rsquo;s add div in the previous page.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML.

Instead of div, a section can be also used\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;30 Days Of HTML\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;first-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Building Blocks of the web\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; There is not website without HTML.

The sign of $w^Tx=0$ tells us which side of the plane $w^Tx=0$, the point x lies on. Thus by taking threshold as 0, perceptron classifies data based on which side of the plane the new point lies on.\nThe task during training is to arrive at the plane (defined by w) that accurately classifies the training data. If the data is linearly separable, perceptron training always converges\nLogistic Regression In Logistic regression, we take weighted linear combination of input features and pass it through a sigmoid function which outputs a number between 1 and 0. Unlike perceptron, which just tells us which side of the plane the point lies on, logistic regression gives a probability of a point lying on a particular side of the plane. The probability of classification will be very close to 1 or 0 as the point goes far away from the plane. The probability of classification of points very close to the plane is close to 0.5.\nSVM There can be multiple hyperplanes that separate linearly separable data. SVM calculates the optimal separating hyperplane using concepts of geometry.\nPerceptron Model Definition of Perceptron Model A perceptron model, in Machine Learning, is a supervised learning algorithm of binary classifiers. A single neuron, the perceptron model detects whether any function is an input or not and classifies them in either of the classes.\n Representing a biological neuron in the human brain, the perceptron model or simply a perceptron acts as an artificial neuron that performs human-like brain functions. A linear ML algorithm, the perceptron conducts binary classification or two-class categorization and enables neurons to learn and register information procured from the inputs.\n There are 4 constituents of a perceptron model. They are as follows-\n Input values Weights and bias Net sum Activation function  The perceptron model enables machines to automatically learn coefficients of weight which helps in classifying the inputs. Also recognized as the Linear Binary Classifier, the perceptron model is extremely efficient and helpful in arranging the input data and classifying the same in different classes.\nHow perceptron model operates  Enter bits of information that are supposed to serve as inputs in the first layer (Input Value). All weights (pre-learned coefficients) and input values will be multiplied. The multiplied values of all input values will be added. The bias value will shift to the final stage (activation function/output result). The weighted input will proceed to the stage of the activation function. The bias value will be now added. The value procured will be the output value that will determine if the output will be released or not.

Being a lazy classifier, it is difficult to use this for prediction in real time. The decision boundaries you achieve with K-NN are much more complex than any decision trees, thus obtaining a nice classification. When you are solving a problem which directly focusses on finding similarity between observations. K-NN does better because of its inherent nature to optimize locally. This is also a flipside because, outliers can significantly kill the performance. Additionally, K-NN is most likely to overfit, and hence adjusting k to maximize test set performance is the way to go. As the complexity of the space grows, the accuracy of K-NN comes down and you would need more data, but the order of this classifier is $n^2$ and it becomes too slow. So, a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA, SVD etc are typically applied and subsequently this classifier is used.\nNaive Bayes is an eager learning classifier and it is much faster than K-NN. Thus, it could be used for prediction in real time. Typically, email spam filtering uses Naive Bayes classifier. It takes a probabilistic estimation route and generates probabilities for each class. It assumes conditional dependence between the features and uses a maximum likelihood hypothesis. The best part with this classifier is that, it learns over time. In a spam filtering task, the type of spam words in email evolves over time. In the same way, the classifier also calculates probability estimates for the newly occurring spam words in a\u0026quot;bag of words\u0026quot;model and makes sure it performs well. This feature of the classifier is due to the inherent nature of the algorithm being generative and not discriminative.\nWhy Naive Bayes is Naive?

Compute the distance between currently classifier sample and training points, remember the index of the element with the smallest distance (ignore previously selected points) 2. Add the class at found index to the counter Return the class with the most votes as a prediction This is a nested loop structure, where the outer loop takes k steps and the inner loop takes n steps. 3rd point is $O(1$) and 4th is $O(\\text{number of classes})$, so they are smaller. Additionally, we have to take into consideration the numer of dimensions d, more directions mean longer vectors to compute distances. Therefore, we have $O(n * k * d)$ time complexity.\nAs for space complexity, we need a small vector to count the votes for each class. It’s almost always very small and is fixed, so we can treat it as a O(1) space complexity.\nBall tree method Training time complexity: $O(d * n * log(n))$\nTraining space complexity: $O(d * n)$\nPrediction time complexity: $O(k * log(n))$\nPrediction space complexity: $O(1)$\nBall tree algorithm takes another approach to dividing space where training points lie. In contrast to k-d trees, which divides space with median value “cuts”, ball tree groups points into “balls” organized into a tree structure. They go from the largest (root, with all points) to the smallest (leaves, with only a few or even 1 point). It allows fast nearest neighbor lookup because nearby neighbors are in the same or at least close “balls”.\nDuring the training phase, we only need to construct the ball tree. There are a few algorithms for constructing the ball tree, but the one most similar to k-d tree (called “k-d construction algorithm” for that reason) is $O(d * n * log(n))$, the same as k-d tree.\nBecause of the tree building similarity, the complexities of the prediction phase are also the same as for k-d tree.\nk-d tree method Check a demonstration video here.\nTraining time complexity: $O(d * n * log(n))$\nTraining space complexity: $O(d * n)$\nPrediction time complexity: $O(k * log(n))$\nPrediction space complexity: $O(1)$\nDuring the training phase, we have to construct the k-d tree. This data structure splits the k-dimensional space (here k means k dimensions of space, don’t confuse this with k as a number of nearest neighbors!) and allows faster search for nearest points, since we “know where to look” in that space. You may think of it like a generalization of BST for many dimensions. It “cuts” space with axis-aligned cuts, dividing points into groups in children nodes.\nConstructing the k-d tree is not a machine learning task itself, since it stems from computational geometry domain, so we won’t cover this in detail, only on conceptual level. The time complexity is usually $O(d * n * log(n))$, because insertion is $O(log(n))$ (similar to regular BST) and we have n points from the training dataset, each with d dimensions. I assume the efficient implementation of the data structure, i. e. it finds the optimal split point (median in the dimension) in O(n), which is possible with the median of medians algorithm. Space complexity is $O(d * n)$ — note that it depends on dimensionality d, which makes sense, since more dimensions correspond to more space divisions and larger trees (in addition to larger time complexity for the same reason).\nAs for the prediction phase, the k-d tree structure naturally supports “k nearest point neighbors query” operation, which is exactly what we need for kNN. The simple approach is to just query k times, removing the point found each time — since query takes $O(log(n))$, it is $O(k * log(n))$ in total. But since the k-d tree already cuts space during construction, after a single query we approximately know where to look — we can just search the “surroundings” around that point. Therefore, practical implementations of k-d tree support querying for whole k neighbors at one time and with complexity $O(sqrt(n) + k)$, which is much better for larger dimensionalities, which are very common in machine learning.\nThe above complexities are the average ones, assuming the balanced k-d tree. The O(log(n)) times assumed above may degrade up to $O(n)$ for unbalanced trees, but if the median is used during the tree construction, we should always get a tree with approximately $O(log(n))$ insertion/deletion/search complexity.\nChoosing the method in practice To summarize the complexities: brute force is the slowest in the big O notation, while both k-d tree and ball tree have the same lower complexity. How do we know which one to use then?\nTo get the answer, we have to look at both training and prediction times, that’s why I have provided both. The brute force algorithm has only one complexity, for prediction, $O(k * n)$. Other algorithms need to create the data structure first, so for training and prediction they get $O(d * n * log(n) + k * log(n))$, not taking into account the space complexity, which may also be important. Therefore, where the construction of the trees is frequent, the training phase may outweigh their advantage of faster nearest neighbor lookup.\nShould we use k-d tree or ball tree? It depends on the data structure — relatively uniform or “well behaved” data will make better use of k-d tree, since the cuts of space will work well (near points will be close in the leaves after all cuts). For more clustered data the “balls” from the ball tree will reflect the structure better and therefore allow for faster nearest neighbor search. Fortunately, Scikit-learn supports “auto” option, which will automatically infer the best data structure from the data.\nLet’s see this in practice on two case studies, which I’ve encountered in practice during my studies and job.\nCase study 1: classification The more “traditional” application of the kNN is the classification of data. It often has quite a lot of points, e. g. MNIST has 60k training images and 10k test images. Classification is done offline, which means we first do the train ing phase, then just use the results during prediction. Therefore, if we want to construct the data structure, we only need to do so once. For 10k test images, let’s compare the brute force (which calculates all distances every time) and k-d tree for 3 neighbors:\nBrute force $(O(k * n))$: 3 * 10,000 = 30,000\nk-d tree $ (O(k * log(n)))$: 3 * log(10,000) ~ 3 * 13 = 39\nComparison: 39 / 30,000 = 0.0013\nAs you can see, the performance gain is huge! The data structure method uses only a tiny fraction of the brute force time. For most datasets this method is a clear winner.\nCase study 2: real-time smart monitoring Machine Learning is commonly used for image recognition, often using neural networks. It’s very useful for real-time applications, where it’s often integrated with cameras, alarms etc. The problem with neural networks is that they often detect the same object 2 or more times — even the best architectures like YOLO have this problem. We can actually solve it with nearest neighbor search with a simple approach:\n  Calculate the center of each bounding box (rectangle)\n  For each rectangle, search for its nearest neighbor (1NN)\n  If points are closer than the selected threshold, merge them (they detect the same object)\n  The crucial part is searching for the closest center of another bounding box (point 2). Which algorithm should be used here? Typically we have only a few moving objects on camera, maybe up to 30–40. For such a small number, speedup from using data structures for faster lookup is negligible. Each frame is a separate image, so if we wanted to construct a k-d tree for example, we would have to do so for every frame, which may mean 30 times per second — a huge cost overall. Therefore, for such situations a simple brute force method works fastest and also has the smallest space requirement (which, with heavy neural networks or for embedded CPUs in cameras, may be important).\nHow to choose a proper k?

In the classification problem, $Y$ takes values in a finite, unordered set.  Vector of $p$ predictor measurements $X$ (also called inputs, regressors, covariates, features, independent variables)\nUnsupervised Learning Starting Point  No outcome varibale, just a set of predictors (features) measured on a set of samples. Objective is more fuzzy - find groups of samples that behave similarly, find features that behave similarly, find linear combinations of features with the most variation. Difficult to know how well you are doing. Different from supervised learning, but can be useful as a pre-processing step for supervised learning or as an exploratory analysis tool  Our objectives  Accurately predict unseen test cases. Understand which inputs affect the outcome, and how. Access the quality of our predictions and inferences.  ML is to generalize knowledge beyond the training examples\nPhilosophy   It is important to understand the ideas behind the various techniques, in order to know how and when to use them.\n  One has to understand the simpler methods first, in order to grasp the more sophisticated ones.\n  It is important to accurately assess the performance of a method, to know how well or how badly it is working [simple methods often perform as well as fancier ones!]\n  Supervised learning : regression problems Find feature and response $X$(Independent variable, feature, covariate, input): TV, Radio, Newspaper\n$Y$(Dependent variable, target, response, output): Sales\nWe try to build a model: $$ \\text{Sales} \\approx f(\\text{TV, Radio, Newspaper}) $$ We can refer to the input vector collectively as: $$ X=\\left(\\begin{array}{l} X_{1} \\ X_{2} \\ X_{3} \\end{array}\\right) $$ Now we can write our model as: $$ Y=f(x) + \\varepsilon $$ $\\varepsilon$ captures measurement errors and other discrepancies.\nWhat is regression function? The ideal $f(x)=E(Y|X=x)$ Is called the regression function.\nWhat is our goal? $f(x)$ is optimal predictor of $Y$ with regard to mean-squared prediction error $$ \\text{Minimize}:E\\left[(Y-g(X))^{2} \\mid X=x\\right] $$\nHow to estimate $f$ ? Typically we have few if any data points with $X=4$ exactly, so we cannot compute $E(Y|X=x)$ !\nWhat we do is to relax the definition and let:\n$$ \\hat{f}(x)=\\operatorname{Ave}(Y \\mid X \\in \\mathcal{N}(x)) $$ where $\\mathcal{N}(x)$ is some neighborhood of $x$.\nBuild linear model $$ f_{L}(X)=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} X_{1}+\\beta_{2} X_{2}+\\cdots+\\beta_{p} X_{p} $$\n  A linear model is specified in terms of $p+1$ parameters $\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\u0026hellip;,\\beta_p$\n  We estimate the parameters by fitting the model to training data\n  Although it is almost never correct, a linear model often serves as a good and interpretable approximation to the unknown true function $f(X)$\n  Interpretability and Flexibility  Why under-fitting is bad?  If a model is under-fitting, it means the model even cannot fit the training data, let alone the testing data or use it in real-world cases   Why over-fitting is bad?  Although the model can fit training data well, but it\u0026rsquo;s too \u0026ldquo;well\u0026rdquo;, we cannot use it in other cases.   How do we know when the fit is just right? Parsimony v.s. black box  We often prefer a simpler model involving fewer variables over a black-box predictor involving them all.    Accessing Model Accuracy Suppose we fit a model $\\hat{f}(x)$ to some training data $\\operatorname{Tr}=\\left{x_{i}, y_{i}\\right}_{1}^{n}$, and we wish to see how it performs.\nWe could compute the average squared prediction error over $\\text{Tr}$: $$ M S E_{T r}=A v e_{i \\in \\operatorname{Tr}}\\left[y_{i}-\\hat{f}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2} $$ And then we compute it using fresh test data $\\operatorname{Te}=\\left{x_{i}, y_{i}\\right}{1}^{n}$ : $$ M S E{T e}=A v e_{i \\in \\operatorname{Te}}\\left[y_{i}-\\hat{f}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2} $$ Black curve is truth. Red curve on right is $M S E_{T e}$. Grey curve is $M S E_{T r}$.\nOrange, blue and green curves/squares correspond to fits of different flexibility.\nChoose the flexibility based on average test error amounts to a bias-variance trade-off.\nSupervised learning : classification problems Here the response variable $Y$ is qualitative , e.g. email is one of $\\C = \\text{(spam, ham)}$, ham is good email ; digit class is one of $\\C = {0, 1, \u0026hellip;,9}$.\nOur goals  Build a classifier $C(X)$ That assigns a class label from $\\C$ to a future unlabeled observation $X$ Access the uncertainty in each classification Understand the roles of the different predictors among $X=X_1, X_2,\u0026hellip;,X_p$  Bayes optimal classifier Suppose the $K$ elements in $\\C$ Are numbered $1,2,\u0026hellip;,K$, Let: $$ p_k(x)=\\text{Pr}(Y=K|X=x),k=1,2,\u0026hellip;K $$ These are the conditional/posterior class probabilities at x. Suppose those class probabilities are known, the Bayes optimal classifier at $x$ is: $$ C(x)=j \\text { if } p_{j}(x)=\\max \\left{p_{1}(x), p_{2}(x), \\ldots, p_{K}(x)\\right} $$\n","permalink":"/post/2022-01-21notedata-mining-analysis-intro/","summary":"Some basic Python summary","title":"Note|Data Mining \u0026 Analysis Intro Ep.0"},{"content":"Create table CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (\u0026#34;CustomerID\u0026#34; INT, \u0026#34;PartySize\u0026#34; INT) Insert data INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (ID, NUMBER) VALUES (123,81) INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (ID, NUMBER) VALUES ((SELECT ID FROM COLUMN_NAME WHERE Email=\u0026#34;1232@GMAIL.com\u0026#34;), 4) Look for similarity SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, Reservation.Date FROM Reservation JOIN Customer AS C ON C.ID = Reservation.ID WHERE C.LastName LIKE \u0026#34;Ste%\u0026#34; Check availablity SELECT COUNT(Books.Title) FROM Loans JOIN Books ON Loads.BookID = Books.BookID WHERE Books.Title = \u0026#34;Dracula\u0026#34; AND Loans.ReturnedDate IS NULL Filter _ underscore: a single character wildcard.\n% percent sign: a wildcard for one or more characters.\n* asterisk: represents zero or more characters\nSQL string funcitons SUBSTR( string, start, length ) LENGTH( string ) TRIM( string) #Trimming is case sensitive.

(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.   1.1 Solution we use stack to solve this problem:\n If there is a (, we add it to stack because it must match with a ) to get valid value back; If there is a ), we can try to match it with the top value in stack: we can either +1 or *2, here is a tricky way to tackle it: we always choose the greater one : (2 * last) or 1  def scoreOfParentheses(self, s: str) -\u0026gt; int: # Create stack stack = [0] for c in s: if c == \u0026quot;(\u0026quot;: stack.append(0) else: last = stack.pop() stack[-1] += (2 * last) or 1 print(stack) return stack[-1] ","permalink":"/post/2022-01-14leetcodepython-856-score-of-parentheses/","summary":"Use stack to tackle this type of matching problem","title":"Leetcode|Python 856 Score of Parentheses"},{"content":"Basic data type: Double String Logic\nIf the items are not of the same type, they are coerced:\nstring \u0026lt;-- numeric \u0026lt;-- logical\nnegative indexes (used for exclusion)\nAutomatic vector extension makes vectors very different from matrices and arrays, for which automatic extension does not exist.\nLists are sequences of anything.
